# NeuroIDS Dataset

The **NeuroIDS Dataset** is a curated collection of flow-level network traffic records created for research and development in **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** using **deep learning**. It is optimized for hybrid architectures like **CNN+LSTM**, enabling both spatial and temporal feature learning.

## ðŸ“– Description
- Contains **normal and malicious** traffic flows.  
- Includes multiple attack categories: DoS, brute-force, infiltration, botnet, and port scans.  
- Flow-level features: IPs, ports, protocols, packet/byte counts, timestamps, session durations.  
- Designed for compactness, efficiency, and real-world applicability.  

## ðŸš€ Applications
- Intrusion Detection (IDS/IPS) research  
- Network anomaly detection  
- AI-driven cybersecurity benchmarking  
- Comparative evaluation against datasets like CICIDS2017 and UNSW-NB15
